Algorithm of Jamming_Area_Mapping:

The jamming_area_mapping function takes the simulation area size, jamming center and jamming radius as input. It creates a grid representing the simulation area and initializes a jamming area map.

The jamming area map is generated by iterating at each point in the simulation area. For each point, the distance to each jamming center is calculated. The point is marked as jammed on the jamming area map.

The simulation area, jamming center and jamming radius are defined.

The jamming area_mapping function is called to generate the jamming area map.

The initial plot is set up, showing a map of the jamming area and a circle representing the UAV in the center of the simulation area.

The update function is defined as the animation update function. which took a frame number as input and calculated the new center coordinates for the UAV circle based on the frame number.

In the update function, the center coordinates of the UAV circle are updated, and the circle is redrawn.

The FuncAnimation function is called to create the animation. which uses an update function with a fixed number of frames for each frame and an interval between frames.

The jamming area map and the plot showing the moving UAV circle are displayed.

The animation repeats for a specified number of frames, updates the UAV circle position based on the frame number, and redraws the plot at each frame to simulate the movement of the UAV around the jamming area.
